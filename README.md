# SOME-PYTHON-PROGRAMS
THESE ARE SOME OF THE PROGRAMS MADE IN THE TIME OF GLOBAL PANDEMIC **(Covid-19)**

Main purpose of these python programs being uploaded to GitHub is :
1) To Learn how to use GIT && GITHUB. Interacting with both and all that shit.
2) Make my programs available globally. so that i can change my computer; Destroy it; Fire it; DO anything with it, without being afraid and access it from anywhere..

Will Make sure to keep these Programs Updated.
