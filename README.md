# python-programs
THESE ARE SOME OF THE PROGRAMS MADE IN THE TIME OF GLOBAL PANDEMIC **(Covid-19)**

Main purpose of these python programs being uploaded on GitHub is to :
1) Learn how to use GIT && GITHUB. Interacting with both and all that shit.
2) Make my programs available globally. so that i can change my computer; Destroy it; Fire it; DO anything without being feared and access it from anywhere..

I Would be bringing up my all other stuff here ASAP.
