# SOME-PYTHON-PROGRAMS
THESE ARE SOME OF THE PROGRAMS MADE IN THE TIME OF GLOBAL PANDEMIC **(Covid-19)**

Main purpose of these python programs being uploaded on GitHub is to :
1) Learn how to use GIT && GITHUB. Interacting with both and all that shit.
2) Make my programs available globally. so that i can change my computer; Destroy it; Fire it; DO anything without being feared and access it from anywhere..

Will make sure to keep these programs updated. 

##### If you run into any problems, Feel free to pull





I Would be bringing up my all other stuff here ASAP.
